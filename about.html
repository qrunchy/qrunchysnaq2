            Hello! My name is Merle, I am a queer hobby artist. I live with my lovely partner and our cat. I draft plans for utilities construction for a living, and I mostly draw and goof around on the internet in my free time.
            <p>I first started learning HTML as a kid through neopets, and got into CSS to customize my deviantart journals when I was a teen. I always wanted to build my own site, but only really got into it with a friend in 2022. I take breaks from time to time but I love working on this little project and am always cooking up new ideas for it.</p>
            <p>
            <p>For art I primarily use Clip Studio Paint on a 4th gen iPad Pro 12.9" with an Apple Pencil, though lately I've been trying out traditional media as well.
            <p>If you would like to contact me directly, my email address is <i><SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">user = 'qrunchy';site = '32bit.cafe';document.write(user + '@' + site);</SCRIPT></i>.<br> Please do not send me anything relating to business interests or making money. Any spam, promotional, business related, or inappropriate messages will be ignored and deleted.</p>
