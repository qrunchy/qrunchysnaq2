            Hello! My name is Merle, I am a queer hobby artist living with my lovely partner and our cat. I work full time doing drafting work for utilities construction. I like to draw and play video games in my free time. I also waste a lot of time online lol
            <p>I've been posting art online since I was a little too young to be doing so back in the early 00s. I've been active in the furry community for almost that long, even though I never considered myself a furry until I got back into the scene as an adult. I first started learning HTML as a kid through neopets like so many others. I never managed to get very far but I always wanted to build my own site, and finally fully got into it with a friend in 2022. I'm so happy to finally have my own site and I've been in love with making it for the past year.
            <p>For art I primarily use Clip Studio Paint on a 4th gen iPad Pro 12.9" with an Apple Pencil.
            <p>I play the Sonic Adventure 2 chao garden off and on these days, with mods. I use Chao World Extended, Shaddatic's Enhanced Chao World, and Krzys's chao editor, among various other smaller mods.
            <p>I used to play Guild Wars 2 and Final Fantasy XIV a lot but only occasionally these days.<br>
                    FFXIV main: Skeef Deezer - Reaper/Bard/Warrior<br>
                    Guild wars 2 main: Violena Nightshade - Sylvari Renegade
            <p>If you would like to contact me privately, you can email me at <i><SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">user = 'qrunchy';site = '32bit.cafe';document.write(user + '@' + site);</SCRIPT></i>. Please do not send me anything relating to business interests or making money. Any spam, promotional, business related, or inappropriate messages will be deleted and if you are annoying enough I will block your address.</p>
