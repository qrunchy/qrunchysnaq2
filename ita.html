              <p>My set of carbuncle pins from <a href="https://shop.mallius.net/" target="_blank">Mallius</a> came in the other day so I sat down and reworked my layout to fit them in.</p>

              <p>I ditched the keychains to allow more flexibility in where things are placed, as well as to not worry about them weighing down the chain anymore. I wanted to go find some way to stick them down for more support but didn't have the time today, unfortunately, so we'll see how the pins alone work out until I can get to the craft store. After a lot of scooching things around I'm pretty happy with the placement.<br>
              And here it is in the bag:</p>

              <p>
              I think this will be easier to add more pins in the future, I'm already seeing spots that could be filled. Just might have to start paying attention to the size of what I get next. <br>
              At a certain point I'll probably start splitting them up into more themed inserts when I run out of room lol. I'm already collecting some pins for a second insert that will be more focused on pin and charm designs that aren't based in media franchises. I love really cool original designs and would love to buy and show off more of those. I'm also interested in creating inserts that are more like scrapbooky collages and not so focused on merchandise. I'm just really excited about all the ways one could design ita bag inserts and I want to really explore the possibilities! It's gonna take some time though.<br>
              That's all I have for today, if you made it this far I really appreciate it! I hope people enjoy reading my little ita bag journal, it's been fun to write for so far. :3c

                <p>I've been wanting an ita bag for a while, though I was never sure what I'd use it for. I've been collecting more pins and charms since I started going to more cons, so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to display them. I plan to create different themed inserts in the long run, but for now I just wanna show off what small collection I have.</p>

                <p>I got this adorable bag from <a href="https://thehidingghost.com/"  target="_blank">The Hiding Ghost</a>'s Etsy store around the beginning of august and I love it! I was wanting a pastel pink cat shaped bag so mission accomplished hehe. I love that it comes with a cat face insert that I can use as another option. They sell more inserts, but I'm also thinking of making some myself from other materials.<br> I've been gradually adding to it over the past month and a half and it's been so much fun!</p>

                <p>Here it is the day I got it, with the pieces I already had. I attended my first furry cons, Texas Furry Fiesta and Stratosfur this year, and thus also started my pin and charm collection. It's pretty modest but I was proud of it.
                I got each piece from the following sellers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gatomon and vaporeon pins- Culture Shock (mall store)</li>
                    <li>Sylveon pin - <a href="https://mousu.art" target="_blank">Mousu.art</a></li>
                    <li>Raymond pin - <a href="https://www.robotspacejelly.com/" target="_blank">Robot Space Jelly</a></li>
                    <li>Sprigatito charm - <a href="https://glitzyfoxstudios.com/" target="_blank">Glitzy Fox Studios</a></li>
                    <li>Y'Shtola and Emet Selch charms - <a href="https://kiiyame.carrd.co/" target="_blank">Kiiyame</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>The sticky dots I was using to hold the charms in place didn't work well at all so I tried to hang them from pins instead. From what I remember it worked well enough but wasn't very cute, and I still had to keep the sticky dots on the back to keep them in place. Not an ideal solution, and not very cute.

                <p>
                Decided to get a little crafty and hung a chain across the top to add a colorful decorative element, and a cute way to display the acrylic charms. It's not perfect as the charms keep weighing it down but after a little trial and error, I got some blank butterfly pins that have managed to hold pretty well. Adding the small charms to the chain was tough but I really like how they came out.

                <p>And here it is after adding a couple more pins. Tails and Klonoa are my precious baby boys and I love them very much.
                The Tails pin is from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/Reddachi" target="_blank">Reddachi</a> and the Klonoa pin is from <a href="https://myuna-art.com/" target="_blank">Myuna Art</a>.
                I'm probably about to rework my layout to fit two more pins, so my insert has been dismantled for now, but I want to sit down and figure it out soon. I'm planning on making a new post when I get that done.</p>
                <p>I've been having a lot of fun building up my collection and finding fun ways to display them, I can't wait to really fill out the design. I hope to keep this blog updated as I do so. I'm excited to have a place to talk about this new hobby and I hope you will follow me on my journey. Thank you so much for reading!</p>
