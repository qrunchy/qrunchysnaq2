        Wow, it's been a sec! Sorry for disappearing for over a year, haha. I have to take large breaks from my hobbies sometimes, and I had a lot going on in 2024.
        <ul><a href="art.php" target="_blank">Art</a>:
          <li>Added archive pages for 2024 and 2014</li>
          <li>Art page now shows this year's work so far</li><br>
        <a href="links.html" target="_blank">Links</a>:
          <li>Created a new link button with the new domain name and removed the outdate ones. I might put them in their own section later? We'll see</li>
          <li>Added icons for my social links</li><br>
        Misc updates:
          <li>Changed the <a href="index.html" target="_blank">home</a> page design a bit, removed the recent art section since it was a pain to update.</li>
          <li>Took down the ita blog for now. I didn't have as much to post as I thought I would, and I want to eventually build an all-purpose blog.</li>
          <li>Shortened my <a href="about.html" target="_blank">about</a> page a bit</li>
          <li>I made a little carrd type page. <a href="https://qrunchy.space/card/" target="_blank">Check it out!</a></li></ul>
