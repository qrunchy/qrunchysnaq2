        Fixed a couple things tonight. I got the broken images in the <a href="https://qrunchysnaq.neocities.org/neutral" target="_blank">neutral chao garden</a> working and I have optimized all the thumbnails in the <a href="https://qrunchysnaq.neocities.org/archive" target="_blank">archives</a> so the galleries should load faster now. I also fixed the header on the <a href="https://qrunchysnaq.neocities.org/catgirls" target="_blank">Catgirl Corner</a> so it displays correctly on desktop now. It's still not quite right on mobile yet, I'll have to fix that later.<br>
        Since <a href="https://sheezy.art/" target="_blank">Sheezy.art</a> is back up and running for existing users, I added a link to my <a href="https://sheezy.art/qrunchy" target="_blank">Sheezy</a> profile to the <a href="https://qrunchysnaq.neocities.org/links" target="_blank">links</a> page. My gallery there isn't quite up to date yet but it should be soon so please check it out if you're interested!

        Happy New Year! Not super quick to the punch but better late than never right? Wanted to get the rest of <a href="art.html" target="_blank">2023's art</a> up before we got too far into 2024. I'll probably be pushing 2023 to the archive and getting this year's work up soon.<br>
        Also, this month some things have started moving forward with some major changes I've been wanting to make on the backend, so I've been quietly working on that. One of the main things I'm excited about is moving the site to a new host. I've been wanting to make the switch for a while, but it was only recently that my host was able to set up the space. So now I'm trying to get it ready to fully launch over there. I will also hopefully be able to do so with a shiny new domain name. I should be able to set up a redirect so the current URL will still work though.<br>
        I'm not sure how long it's going to take to get it all ready, but that's the current project. I'm also once again working on a gallery overhaul on the coding end to make even easier to update, but that's going to have to be on the new site since it'll be using php.<br>
        I apologize for the long absence, but I think I'm back in the swing of things for now. I want to fix up some issues on the current site soon. Sorry if it's another little while before I start really updating visibly again. Want to get this all going again sooner than later, so here's hoping.<br>

        Just wanted to drop in with an update since it's been a sec. I'm currently adjusting to some new meds and it's knocked me off my creative pursuits for the time being. I've been spending more time reading and playing video games lately, not so much making stuff. I'm trying to push myself to dip my toes back into it but it's slow going. That combined with feeling the need to make some pretty large scale changes to the site, I'm a bit stuck moving forward. I hope to get back on the horse sooner than later but for now I'm letting myself take it easy. I'm generally prone to rotating interests, so I expect to reignite my website passion eventually. I've noticed some broken images in the chao garden and I apologize for that! I'll have to look into that... at some point lol. <br>
        Thank you for your patience, I appreciate everyone who has visited and especially those who have left kind messages, I'm still checking in on things periodically. Take care!<br>
